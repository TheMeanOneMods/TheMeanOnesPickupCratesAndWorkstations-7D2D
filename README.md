# TheMeanOnesPickupCratesAndWorkstations-7D2D
Description:
Tired of being stuck with stationary crates and workstations in 7 Days to Die? TheMeanOnes: Pickup Crates and Workstations is here to change that! This mod allows you to pick up and relocate all your essential crafting stations and storage crates with ease—no extra tools required. Just break them, reclaim the item, and place it wherever you need! This mod is a branch off of my original discontinued PickYaCratesUp Mod. ServerSide Friendly!

#Key Features:
Moveable Workstations and Crates: Pick up and relocate workstations like the campfire, forge, workbench, chemistry station, cement mixer, and all writable crates.
Prevents Resource Duplication: No more unintentional resource drops during harvesting or relocation, ensuring fair gameplay.
Simplified Process: No extra tools or recipes are needed. Simply break the block, and it’s returned to your inventory for reuse.
Balanced Gameplay: Eliminates unnecessary resource drops, keeping the game balanced and focused on survival.
Perfect for Base Designers: Easily adjust your base layout or move stations between multiple locations.

#How It Works:
Break the workstation or crate.
It returns to your inventory without dropping unintended resources.
Place it again anywhere you want—no fuss, no mess!

#Notes:
This mod disables harvesting extra resources from workstations and crates to prevent exploits and maintain balance.
It does not affect broken or destroyed variants of these blocks.
It may or may not work on already placed crates or workstations. I did 3 tests and 2 of 3 did not require me to replace blocks and make new ones.


#Take control of your survival journey with TheMeanOnes: Pickup Crates and Workstations—designed for maximum flexibility and efficiency in the apocalypse!
